- Make a backup of the DB;
- Reinstall GLPI from 0;
- Reinstall Room Management plugin;
- Update all of GLPI's files(except config, files and vendor directories(DO yourself a favor, and don't touch these));
- Verify the DB;
- Update GLPI_Reservations(add 'theme' column "ALTER TABLE glpi_reservations ADD theme varchar(255) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci DEFAULT NULL");
- Update GLPI_Reservationitems, GLPI_Plugin_Room_Rooms;
- Fill any empty tables if necessary;
- Hopefully, that should be enough;
- Keep in mind that these steps are specific for an application where there has been no modifications to anything besides
the reservaion and room tables;
